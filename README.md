# sponsors-badge

```This repo is supporting a tier which is intended as a social experiment, where people wanting a sponsor badge in their profile would pay a dollar as sponsoring this idea as well my open source work.```
```
The goals here are:
- to understand if people would pay a dollar for the badge or not
- will publish this in hacker news and lets see how far does it goes
- all money will be later donated to charity institutions
- if you liked this experiment or any of my repos,
  consider donating some crypto at:
